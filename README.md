# blackjack_project
Still not working but will finish this by adding the score function so whichever player wins will recieve 10 points, whichever player reaches the final score of 100 points, will become the blackjack champion. I will also like to finish the project by adding the images to the decks of cards and also the individual cards delt to player and computer.
